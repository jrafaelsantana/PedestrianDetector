# Pedestrian Detector 🚶

This is a project for personal studies where a neural network capable of identifying when a pedestrian is crossing the street was developed. This project uses [CARLA](https://carla.org) as a simulator and the neural network receives information from an RGB sensor implanted in the vehicle.

## Requirements 📦

1. Carla Simulator 0.9.7.4
2. Python 3.5

To install the Python Packages, run the command in the terminal:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation 📁

This project should be extracted inside of the `PythonAPI` directory. If you want to extract the project in another path, you will need to update the Carla `.egg` file path inside the `main.py` file.
